Hey guys!

I wanted to share that I’ve released version 3.2.0 of [Fari](https://fari.app).

This version includes:
- A brand new Drawing Area with has support for multiple shapes, colors and even player tokens. 
  - 👏 [ddkn](https://github.com/ddkn) for the designs
- Brazilian Portuguese translations 
  - 👏 [pedrogsribeiro](https://github.com/pedrogsribeiro) for the translations
- French translations for the About Page 
  - 👏 [corrinachow](https://github.com/corrinachow) for the translations
- And other minor improvements and bug fixes.

If you want to talk about Fari or have any questions, [start a discussion](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/discussions) on Github.

If you encounter any issues with the app, you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/new/choose) and I'll look into it as fast as possible.

As usual, feedback is more than welcome and if you can, please consider supporting Fari by [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/rpdeshaies).
